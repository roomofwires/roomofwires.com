          <p class="pt-2">
            Even after ten yrs, we've still never met, preferring to work in
            complete isolation from each other, inhabiting a murky world of
            Discord servers, shared drives, and wide area networks.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-2">
            Always eager to explore new ground, we invited some of our past
            allies to re-work a few highlights from the last decade, as well as
            a couple of re-workings from ourselves. And, it felt right that this
            release should go out on S27, the label that helped start our
            journey.
          </p>
          <p class="pt-2">
            So, here's to the next decade, whatever it may bring. For now, enjoy
