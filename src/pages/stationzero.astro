              This is a collaboration described as a perpetual battle. From both
              sides of the Atlantic we've fought to create an epic album. It's
              totally absorbing, from start to finish, a luscious rollercoaster
              of dark and even darker.

              The album Carbon Based Shrine is a really intense listen, it led
              to conversations with Cold Spring Records and then onto ant-zen
              out of Germany.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-2">
              This new album is complete now and will be released during 2023 by
              ant-zen.
