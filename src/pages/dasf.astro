              DasF is the meeting of The Dronefynder General and the two Andrews
              from Room of Wires, in a deep connection of time and sound.

              Creating dark, urgent and unsettling electronica, forged from
              evaporating melodies and throbbing layers of sonic disquiet.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-2">
              Anonymous found fragments from passing encounters and urban
              moments are weaved with deep and lugubrious oscillations across
              lethean sonic waters. Half memoriesâ€¦ the fleeting unfolding of
              themes and sound spaces. Darkness with occasional chinks of light.
              DasF.
